    <p>starbase is a production-ready website boilerplate built with webpack 5, Babel 7 & Sass that enables developers
      to get up and running in minutes using some of the most powerful front-end tools available in 2021:</p>
    <ul class="header__features">
      <li><a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack">webpack
          5</a> & <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server">webpack-dev-server</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/babel/babel">Babel 7</a> w/ <a href="https://github.com/eslint/eslint">ESLint</a>
        & <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sass">Sass</a> w/ <a href="https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint">stylelint</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The primary mission is to be small in scope so that it may be easily extended and customized, or used as a
      learning tool for developers who are trying to become familiar with webpack 5, Sass and/or modern JS.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>After completing the steps below, you will be ready to begin using starbase:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> (latest
          LTS recommended)</li>
        <li>Clone starbase into your project root directory</li>
        <li>Install dependencies by running <code>npm install</code> in your project root directory</li>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Local Development</h3>
      <p>starbase uses <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server">webpack-dev-server</a>
        to serve up your project at <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> for
        streamlined and
        convenient development.</p>

      <p>After running <code>npm run start</code> in the project root, your <code>/src</code> code will be served
        at the url above and
        watched for changes. As you modify code in <code>/src</code>, the project will be recompiled and your
        browser will
        refresh to show the latest changes.</p>

      <pre>cd /path/to/starbase
npm run start</pre>

      <h3>Building for Production</h3>
      <p>Use <code>npm run build</code> in your project root to run a production build.</p>
      <p>Production builds compile & minify your assets into <code>/dist</code> for distribution and/or
        integration into
        whatever codebase you'll be using these assets in.</p>

      <pre>cd /path/to/starbase
npm run build</pre>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Features & Configurations</h2>
      <h3>JS & Sass linting</h3>
      <p>starbase uses <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> for Javascript (ES6) linting
        and <a href="https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint">stylelint</a> for Sass
        linting to encourage consistent
        code throughout your project. The configs (<code>/.eslintrc.js</code> and <code>/.stylelintrc.js</code>
        respectively) include a
        solid foundation to build upon, utilizing the most popular industry-standardized plugins such as
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb">eslint-config-airbnb</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/bjankord/stylelint-config-sass-guidelines">stylelint-config-sass-guidelines</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Prettier JS Formatting</h3>
      <p>starbase uses <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a> to
        enforce and simplify code
        consistency. If you use VS Code, check out the <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">Prettier VS Code
          extension</a>.</p>

      <h3>HTML Webpack Plugin</h3>
      <p>starbase uses <a href="https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin">HTML
          Webpack Plugin</a>, which enables webpack to
        handle assets that are linked from within our HTML templates, such as images and embedded videos. It
        also makes sure our generated <code>.js</code> & <code>.css</code> files are included where they need to
        be.</p>
      <p>Open the webpack configs if you need to add more pages -- and be sure to check out the plugin
        documentation to learn about the more advanced features such as <code>.ejs</code> and environment
        variable support.</p>

      <h3>Asset Hashing (Cache Busting)</h3>
      <p>The assets generated by starbase are <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/caching/">hashed</a> as a
        cache-busting
        mechanism. Hashes are generated via file contents so they will only change when the files themselves
        have changed.</p>
      <p>This feature ships with webpack (and the loaders we use), so removing it is pretty straightforward. Open
        the webpack configs and remove the hashes from the filenames, which should look something like this:
        <code>.[hash:8]</code>.
      </p>
      <p>Removing hashing for production builds is not recommended.</p>

      <h3>Build-Time Cleanup</h3>
      <p>starbase is setup to clear all contents of <code>/dist</code> (where compiled assets are piped into)
        during each <code>npm run build</code>. If you'd like to remove this part of the build process, perform
        the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>remove <code>CleanWebpackPlugin</code> from the plugins array in
          <code>/webpack/webpack.config.prod.js</code>
        </li>
        <li>remove <code>CleanWebpackPlugin</code> as a requirement at the top of
          <code>/webpack/webpack.config.prod.js</code>
        </li>
        <li>remove the <code>CleanWebpackPlugin</code> dependency from <code>/package.json</code></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Removing the cleanup process means that deleted assets in <code>/src</code> will not be deleted in
        <code>/dist</code>
        until you
        manually do so. I recommend keeping the cleanup process intact unless you have a specific reason not to,
        such as having un-managed assets in <code>/dist</code>.
      </p>

      <h3>Fetch & Promise Polyfills</h3>
      <p>Because starbase was built to accommodate ES6 & CommonJS (and not jQuery) it is assumed that you'll be
        using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a> for
        asynchronous
        requests.</p>
      <p>Fetch is supported in all modern browsers, but some old dogs still don't support it and that's what we
        need the <a href="https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise">es6-promise</a> &
        <a href="https://github.com/github/fetch">whatwg-fetch</a> polyfills for.
      </p>
      <p>If you want to remove these for any reason, perform the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>remove <code>es6-promise</code> & <code>whatwg-fetch</code> from <code>/package.json</code></li>
        <li>remove the relevant imports in <code>/src/app.js</code></li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Notes & Considerations</h2>

      <h3>Root Path</h3>
      <p>starbase is setup to run with assets referenced via relative paths so generated <code>.html</code> files
        can be opened without needing a deployment. If you plan on deploying to a web server, it'll be a good
        idea to set the <code>publicPath</code> in <code>/webpack/webpack.config.base.js</code>.</p>
      <p>This variable should be set to <code>/</code> if the app will run at the root of a domain or subdomain,
        or to <code>/folderName</code> (example) if it'll be deployed to a subfolder.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>License</h2>
      <p>starbase is open source and free software, so you may to do whatever you wish with it -- commercially or
        personally. You can buy me a beer next time you're in Boston, star the project and tell a friend, or you
        can erase all signs of origin and tell your coworkers that you made it yourself. It's all good!</p>
