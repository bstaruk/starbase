# Templates

This is where you'll warehouse the HTML documents that you create and the assets used on them.

The CSS and JS assets generated by Webpack will be injected into your templates, and all HTML code will be minified for production builds.

To add a new template, create the appropriate HTML file (use `index.html` as an example) and add it to your webpack build. Refer to [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) documentation and `/webpack/webpack.config.base.js` for more information on that.
