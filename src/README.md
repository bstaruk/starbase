# Src

This is your src folder, which is the top-level container for the different types of source code that comes together to create the application.

If you'll be renaming or reorganizing the child folders of `/src` be sure to reflect those changes in your build (`/webpack`) and package (`/package.json`) files to avoid build failures.
