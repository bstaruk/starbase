# App

This is your app folder. Any code that is stored here should affect the entire application.

[BEM](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example) is love. BEM is life. Styles should be typically defined with class names and not element types, so keep as much of it as possible in the `../components/` folder as possible.
