## Usage

If you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)) installed, run `nvm use` in the project root to detect and use the recommended version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

If you do not have nvm installed, you'll need to refer to the `.nvmrc` file to verify your version of Node is compatible with the recommended version.

### Getting Started

Start by running `npm install` in the project root to install dependencies.

---

### Developing Locally

After running `npm run dev` in the project root, `src` will be served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Any changes made within `src` will trigger the source to recompile and refresh the page in your web browser.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

Run `npm run build` in the project root to compile and minify the source into `/dist` for integration or deployment.

```bash
npm run build
```
