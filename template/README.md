## Installation

To get started, ensure you are using a compatible version of Node, then install the project dependencies:

```bash
nvm use
npm install
```

Reference `.nvmrc` (used by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) for the suggested version of Node.

## Usage

### Developing Locally

After running `npm run dev` in the project root, `src` will be served at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Any changes made to code in `src` will trigger recompilation of the project and refresh the page in your browser.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

Run `npm run build` in the project root to run a production build.

Production builds compile & minify your assets into `/dist` for distribution and/or integration into whatever codebase you'll be using these assets in.

```bash
npm run build
```
