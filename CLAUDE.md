# CLAUDE.md

Starbase is a front-end starter kit. The template app and its conventions live in `template/`.

See `template/CLAUDE.md` for all coding conventions, patterns, and project-specific guidance.

## Writing Style (docs, READMEs, descriptions)

- **No em dashes.** Use colons, periods, commas, or restructure the sentence instead.
- **Avoid the "not X, it's Y" contrastive pattern.** Once or twice is fine. Five times in one page is a tic. Vary sentence structure.
- **Space mission theme.** Section names and vocabulary lean into the Starbase identity: Liftoff, Payload, Star Chart, Mission Control, Comms. Keep it consistent but not exhausting.
- **Personal, technical, nerdy tone.** Write like a developer who's genuinely excited about this stuff. Fun and quirky, not corporate. Think NASA mission briefing written by someone who grew up on Star Trek.
- **Claude-first, not Claude-friendly.** Starbase is built around Claude Code from the ground up. Docs should reflect that Claude is the co-pilot, not an optional add-on.
- **Brian Staruk and project history belong in the History section** of the root README only. No personal mentions in the template README.
