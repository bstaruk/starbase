# Starbase v4

Starbase is a production-ready static website boilerplate featuring Webpack 5, TypeScript, PostCSS & Tailwind CSS.

Begin developing in minutes with some of the most powerful front-end technologies available in 2024, powered by a delightfully simple and fully featured developer experience.

The primary mission of Starbase is to be simple -- easily configured, extended and integrated. This also happens to make it a great platform for web developers to become more familiar with bare-metal Webpack configs, TypeScript and/or Tailwind CSS.
